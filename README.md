BPLG is an attempt at a delightfully exessive *wireless haptic feedback device.*

The Goals for this device is to create a wireless vibrational butt plug that is
- open source
- cost effective & accessible
- supports [buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io/) 
- comfortable
- **safe!**

We also aim to achieve a device that is
- easy to assemble
- long running
- powerful
- versatile
- responsive
 
Design of the butt plug is broken down to:
- KiCad Files (PCBA)
- Freecad Files (TOPA)
